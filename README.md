### Explore US Bikeshare Data


### My project entailed me writing Python code to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major cities in th US,
 by providing a user interface that required the user to input data and the required information was calculated and outputed. 

### new_york_city.csv, washington.csv, chicago.csv

### I'd like to thank all my Udacity mentors for their support through out this project.
